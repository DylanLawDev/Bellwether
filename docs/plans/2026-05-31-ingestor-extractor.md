# Ingestor + Extractor Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build Bellwether's source-agnostic ingestion + extraction core — an HTTP front door, immutable GCS bronze store, durable Postgres work queue, pluggable extraction, and gold time-series aggregation — with GDELT as the first reference producer, deployable to GCP via Terraform.

**Architecture:** External producers `POST /ingest` (FastAPI on Cloud Run). Each submission is written **bronze-first** to GCS, indexed + dedup'd in Postgres, and enqueued in a Postgres `work_queue`. A separate worker (Cloud Run Job, scheduled) leases jobs `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, routes by `content_type` to an extractor, and writes silver (`tags`) + gold (`observations`). Postgres is the transactional spine; GCS holds raw bytes. Everything before `/ingest` (scrapers, LLM agents, file loads) is external to Bellwether.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, `uv`, FastAPI, `psycopg` v3 (sync) + `psycopg_pool`, `google-cloud-storage`, `pydantic` v2, `httpx`, `pytest` + `ruff`. Local dev via docker-compose (Postgres + fake-gcs-server). Deploy: Terraform → GCS + Cloud SQL (Postgres) + Cloud Run (service + job) + Cloud Scheduler + Artifact Registry. CI/CD: GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-05-31-ingestor-extractor-design.md`. **Platform doc:** `README.md`.

## How to run a ticket from your phone (web Claude Code)

Each ticket under `docs/plans/tickets/` is **self-contained**: it names the spec, prerequisite tickets, exact files, interfaces, tests, and acceptance criteria. To dispatch one:

1. Open the repo in Claude Code on the web.
2. Tell it: *"Read `AGENTS.md`, then implement ticket `docs/plans/tickets/T03-bronze-store.md` end to end: work on a branch, follow TDD, run `make check`, and open a PR. Do not merge."*
3. CI (GitHub Actions) runs `make check` on the PR. Review the diff + CI result from your phone and merge.

**Conventions (also in `AGENTS.md`, created in T00) that every ticket relies on:**
- **Branch:** `ticket/T<NN>-<slug>`. **One PR per ticket.** Never merge to `main` without your approval.
- **Verify:** `make check` = `ruff check . && ruff format --check . && pytest -q`. A ticket is "done" only when `make check` is green.
- **Commits:** small, conventional (`feat:`, `test:`, `chore:`), frequent — commit after each green test.
- **TDD:** failing test first, minimal code to pass, refactor. No implementation without a test that pins it.
- **Don't invent scope:** if a ticket needs something not yet built, it lists it as a prerequisite — do that ticket first, don't stub past it.

## Build order & dependency graph

```
T00 scaffold ─┬─▶ T01 config/db ─┬─▶ T02 migrations ─┬─▶ T03 bronze ─┐
              │                  │                    ├─▶ T05 queue ──┤
              │                  └─▶ T04 contracts ───┘               ├─▶ T06 ingest ─▶ T07 api ─▶ T08 client
              │                                                       │
              ├─▶ T09 registry ─▶ T10 gdelt-extractor ────────────────┴─▶ T11 worker+gold ─▶ T12 gdelt-producer
              │
              └─▶ T13 terraform/GCP infra  (INDEPENDENT — can be done anytime, in parallel)
                  └─▶ T14 CI/CD deploy wiring (needs T13 + a runnable image from T07/T11)

  Web UI track (prototype already on a branch; mock data, packaged at src/bellweather/web/):
  T07 api + T11 worker ─▶ T15 read API ─▶ T16 web live backend ─▶ T17 single-app deploy (needs T14)
```

**Recommended sequence:** T00 → T01 → T02 → (T03, T04 in parallel) → T05 → T06 → T07 → T08 → (T09 → T10) → T11 → T12. Run **T13 (Terraform)** early/in-parallel since it's independent — it's the "plug into GCP" piece you asked for. T14 wires deploy once an image exists.

**End-to-end "done" for this epic:** submit a fixture GDELT GKG batch through `BellwetherClient` → rows appear in `tags` and `observations`; `make check` green; deployed stack reachable on Cloud Run with `terraform apply`.

## Self-review notes

- **Spec coverage:** ingestion contract (T04), HTTP front door (T07), bronze-first immutability (T06), durable queue (T05), one extractor behind a registry (T09/T10), gold time series (T11), GDELT reference producer (T12), GCP deploy + cost (T13/T14), testing (every ticket TDD). Out-of-scope items (market feed, entity resolution, research layer) are intentionally absent.
- **Type consistency:** shared signatures (`Submission`, `IngestResult`, `BronzeStore.put/get`, `enqueue/lease/ack/fail`, `Extractor.extract`, `aggregate_observations`) are defined once in their owning ticket and referenced by exact name elsewhere.
- **No placeholders:** load-bearing code (schemas, SQL, queue semantics, extractor parsing, Terraform, CI) is given in full inside the tickets; routine glue is specified by signature + test.
